# Web-Scraping-Python

Dependencies: BeautifulSoup and selenium

This application enters the eMAG website with webdriver and gets all the data from the page with BeautifulSoup.
Once I have all the data, I eliminate the tags not related to producs or price, and I store all the products in arrays.
With a simple print I can see all the products (from the first page) that are currently selling.
